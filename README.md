The OSCAR project exemplifies an intricate data integration and analysis initiative that employed a combination of PowerQuery and Tableau, 
showcasing the significance of these tools in managing and extracting insights from complex datasets.

The initial step involved merging the 'movies' and 'oscar' datasets, a task seamlessly executed using PowerQuery's merge queries capability. 
This process was crucial for establishing a foundational link between the two datasets, ensuring that subsequent analyses would be conducted on a 
consolidated and coherent dataset. The merging process relied on matching entries based on the common fields of 'title' and 'year', 
demonstrating the versatility of PowerQuery in handling data integration challenges.

Following data integration, PowerQuery played a pivotal role in cleaning and transforming the dataset. Techniques such as Find&Replace, Splitting etc
were implemented to address formatting inconsistencies in columns like 'genres,' 'production_companies,' and 'production_countries.' 
Additionally, the unpivoting of data facilitated a more granular exploration of the information, laying the groundwork for nuanced analyses.

The project's transition to Tableau marked a shift towards advanced visualization and exploration of the integrated dataset. The creation of relationships 
between columns from different datasets within Tableau facilitated a seamless flow of information, allowing for a more holistic understanding of the data. 
Tableau's capacity to handle diverse datasets and establish connections between disparate data points enabled the creation of subsets, fostering a more nuanced 
analysis of film-related trends.

The analysis in Tableau yielded valuable insights through a variety of visualizations. Average movie budgets and revenues were effortlessly calculated, 
providing a high-level overview of financial aspects. The comparison between movie budgets and revenues over time, presented in a line chart, enabled the 
identification of trends and patterns. Bar charts were utilized to explore average budgets and revenues across different genres, as well as to analyze nominations 
received from various production companies. Furthermore, line and bar charts provided a temporal perspective on the number of movie nominations and the success of 
films in different genres over the years.The creation of a heat map to illustrate the relationship between vote count and popularity within different genres added a 
layer of complexity to the analysis.
