OSCAR project - 

1. Combined two datasets - 'movies' and 'oscar' on (movies.title = oscar.film) and (movies.year = oscar.year)
using merge queries in PowerQuery. 

Operations on resultant dataset - 

2. Columns 'genres, production_companies, production_countries' had values in the format like ['Drama', 'Family',    
   'Fantasy', 'Romance']
3. To deal with these values, removed "[, ],'" using Find and Replace. Splitted the resultant entry into multiple columns using Split Option where
   , was used as a delimeter. To deal efficiently with this type of data, unpivoted this data to have multiple rows. 

4. Deleted columns like 'crew_female_representation', 'crew_gender', 'cast_gender' from the dataset as they were not useful for analysis. 
5. Rounded values in columns like 'popularity' to upto 2 decimal places using 'Round' function.

6. Broke the dataset into several parts like (film,year,genre), (film,year,production_company), (film,year,production_country), 
   (film,category,popularity,vote_count,vote_avg), (film,year,popularity,budget,revenue,status) for further ease in analysis. 

7. Added these datasets into tableau and used relationships to work with columns not belonging to same dataset.
